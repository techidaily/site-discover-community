## Comprehensive Analysis of the Razer Kishi Ultra Controller - Revolutionizing Phone-Based Video Games

### Key Takeaways

* The Razer Kishi Ultra offers console-quality gaming on your smartphone or iPad mini with full-sized controller ergonomics.
* Easy setup and comfortable design make it ideal for long gaming sessions, but it can feel heavy compared to a Nintendo Switch.
* Despite weight concerns, the Razer Kishi Ultra is a top choice for mobile gaming comfort and functionality.

 I love gaming on my iPad, but I don't love touchscreen gaming, nor do I love connecting a controller and using the iPad as a de facto screen. So when the [Razer Kishi Ultra](http://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004293&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-kishi-ultra-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) offered compatibility with my iPad mini, I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised with how well this Backbone-like controller worked!

#####  Razer Kishi Ultra

9/ 10 

The Razer Kishi Ultra takes the very best of console controller technology and brings it to mobile gaming. With its full-sized controller ergonomics, mecha-tactile buttons, hall effect analog triggers, remappable buttons, and Razer Sensa HD Haptics, the Kishi Ultra is like having a console controller for your smartphone or iPad mini.  

**Pros** 
* Easy to set up
* Comfortable to use, even after long gaming sessions
* Can fit a phone of any size (and the iPad mini) even with a case on

**Cons** 
* Can be a battery drain
* On the heavier side for a portable device

##  Gamer Design for a Hardcore Gaming Device

 Like most Razer products, the Kishi Ultra's aesthetic can only be described as 'gamer-y'. While the black controller seems unassuming, when you plug a device into it, the LED lights on the sides of the Kishi Ultra come on in all their rainbow glory. While I don't mind the lights and think they're a neat touch, others might find them distracting. Thankfully, you can adjust and turn them off in the Nexus app as needed.

 Of course, if you're attaching a physical controller to a phone or iPad, there's no being discrete about gaming on your device. Given that, the Kishi Ultra looks great, and I prefer its looks to the [Backbone One](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-15-series-and-android-2nd-generation-black%2F6558725.p%3FskuId%3D6558725).

 But when it comes to controllers, comfort is king, and the Kishi Ultra excels on that front. The shape of each side of the controller is similar to an Xbox controller, so it fits comfortably in my hands regardless of how far apart the two sides are.

 It's easy to get devices in and out of the Razer Kishi Ultra, even if you use it with the iPad mini in a case. In addition, there are rubber inserts of different heights you can use to make sure the device fits snuggly into the controller, ensuring that nothing rattles while you're playing.

 In general, I was surprised by how well-equipped the Kishi Ultra is to handle anything. I expected it to be difficult for my iPad to get in and out of the controller, as other mobile controllers I tried in the past were too tight a fit with larger phones. To have the controller both hold the device snuggly and make it easy to get your device in and out of it is no small feat, but Razer managed to do it.

 This is all good, but how does the Razer Kishi Ultra hold up to an extended game session?

##  Putting the Razer Kishi Ultra to the Test

![The Razer Kishi Ultra fully extended](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/53736584013_9e703c5cee_o.jpg)

 I find Razer's marketing of the Kishi Ultra to feature "Genshin Impact" very clever—that was the first game I wanted to test out. While it was a mobile game at first, it was a terrible game to play on the touchscreen, and playing it on PC or PS5 never interested me. But even a physical controller on a smartphone doesn't quite work for the game; the phone screen is too small to see what's happening in an action RPG.

 So, I downloaded "Genshin" and set up the Kishi Ultra on my iPad mini. The setup was incredibly easy. All I had to do was plug it in, launch the Nexus app to have the iPad read the controller, launch the game, and press the physical Nexus button on the controller. This allowed the app to register the game, and the game would read the controller without a problem.

 When playing "Genshin," I didn't notice any noticeable lag between button presses and the screen, as expected from a controller plugged directly into the device. I had no issues reaching buttons with my smaller hands, either. My main concern was with the weight of the controller and the iPad.

##  Heavyweight Portable Gaming

 When you connect the iPad mini to the Razer Kishi Ultra, it's a bit awkward but manageable in terms of size. But in terms of weight, you have a 559-gram portable you're holding up (without an iPad case). For reference, the original Nintendo Switch model is 297 grams, and the Steam Deck is a hefty 669 grams, so the Kishi lands a bit on the heavier side for portables. Of course, the weight is lower if you're attaching a smartphone instead—the controller with my Pixel 7a is 459.5 grams—but if you're coming from a Switch, you'll notice the weight difference.

 So with this in mind, I was worried about wrist fatigue. When I first picked up my Steam Deck, I had a lot of trouble with my wrists getting tired after an hour or so of playing. Given the size of the Kishi Ultra, I was worried about the same here, but it ended up not being the case.

 That said, my wrists have likely gotten stronger over time from using the Steam Deck, and the Razer Kishi Ultra with the iPad still manages to weigh less than it. The size can still be a bit unwieldy at times, but given the device and how the controller works, there really isn't another solution if you want the controller attached.

 But, the Kishi Ultra is a great travel companion. While it can't fold down like the regular Kishi, you can keep it connected to your device indefinitely with a USB-C passthrough charging port. It may be a bit awkward to pack and take with you, but if you're looking for a replacement for other portable consoles (and like the mobile game offerings), the Razer Kishi Ultra can be it.

##  Should you Buy the Razer Kishi Ultra?

 I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the [Razer Kishi Ultra](http://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004293&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-kishi-ultra-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), but I came away impressed. I didn't think gaming with my phone or iPad could be this comfortable, and despite a few small sticking points, this is _the_ way to enjoy mobile gaming. The price point is on the higher side, but if you regularly play games on your phone or iPad this is worth the investment for its comfort and portable gaming feel.

 If you play games on your phone regularly, don't hesitate to pick up the Kishi Ultra.
