 The Hiearcool 7-to-1 USB-C Adapter is about the size of a pocket knife and is just as easy to tout around. The aluminum-alloy casting looks sleek, and the matte shell keeps fingerprints and smudges off the accessory. There are several different color options, too, although I went with silver to match the MacBooks in my apartment.

 The actual [USB-C connection](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/) is fixed to one end of the adapter, and it's actually a part of the Hiearcool that I'm not the biggest fan of. The wire itself isn't very flexible, it can't be removed from the adapter chassis, and the lead is only about 1.5 feet long. No, it's not the end of the world that it's not made out of a longer-sized bungee material, but this would have been cool.

 The Hiearcool's 4K HDMI output is located at the other end of the adapter, with the main bank of ports located on the right side of the unit. These include a PD 100W USB-C port, two USB-A ports, an SD card slot, and a TF card slot.

[Higher-end versions of this Hiearcool adaptor](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T9PXW35?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228083&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhiearcool-7-in-1-usb-c-adapter-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) also include an Ethernet port, but the connection is missing from this model. You also won't find silicone padding on any part of the Hiearcool either, so be careful when using the adapter on hard surfaces like tables and desks (it might leave behind a scratch or two).

##  Using the Hiearcool USB-C Adapter: About as Easy as It Gets

* **Transfer Speed:** 5Gbps read and write
* **Card Capacity:** Up to 2TB

 We live in an age of consumer tech where you often need to download an app to get even the simplest devices up and running. At this point, it's something we're all used to, which is why it's always a blessing when all you have to do to get something to work is plug it in. Such is the case with the Hiearcool USB-C Adapter.

 My girlfriend and I used the adapter for both our MacBook Pro models (2020 and 2016), and once we connected it to one of the computer's Thunderbolt ports, it was ready to go instantly. And how do you know the adapter is working? There's an LED indicator on the input side that will light solid white when a connection has been established.

 The original reason for purchasing the Hiearcool was so we could play "Tiny Toons" through our Sega Genesis emulator lag-free. To this end, the adapter works flawlessly. The HDMI output supports 4K at up to 30 frames per second, and I used a 4K-rated Insignia HDMI cable to connect the Hiearcool to my Samsung TV. The 8-bit joy of "Tiny Toons" was now on my 4K TV, sans lag, and the PS4 controller I had mapped to the emulator worked great, too. But seeing as most folks aren't buying a USB-C adapter for '90s gaming nostalgia, what about higher-quality content?

 With the Hiearcool connected to my MacBook Pro, and an HDMI plugged into my TV, I ran through several 4K demo clips from YouTube, and each vignette looked just as good as if it were being streamed directly through the YouTube app on the TV. This is particularly good news for those of us with 4K videos and photos on our computers. While it's hard to match the convenience of AirPlay, AirDrop, and Chromecast, it's nice to know that the Hiearcool gives you a quick and reliable A-to-B means of media transfer.

 I've also had good luck with the Hiearcool's traditional USB ports and SD card slot. The PD-certified USB-C delivers up to 100W of power, so you can charge your MacBook or iPad while using the adapter, even if all the ports on your device are being used. The two 5Gbps USB-A ports are nice for moving files to a USB thumb drive, and I've even used it to power my [Scarlet 2i2 recording interface](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B07QR73T66?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228083&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhiearcool-7-in-1-usb-c-adapter-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate).

 The SD/TF card slots work well, too. On a recent trip to Walt Disney World, we brought our Canon T7 DSLR to take photos, and the Hiearcool made it simple to transfer our pictures and videos at the end of each park day.

 If transfer speed is of the utmost importance, though, the Hiearcool's USB-A ports and SD/TF card slots may be a little too slow for a professional video editor or graphic designer. That said, I think most folks will be satisfied with the adapter's throughput.

##  Should You Buy the Hiearcool 7-in-1 USB-C Adapter?

 The [Hiearcool 7-in-1 USB-C Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Hiearcool-MacBook-Multiport-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B07WPTG7NX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228083&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhiearcool-7-in-1-usb-c-adapter-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is one of the best MacBook accessories I've ever purchased, and for less than $30, it's almost a no-brainer to invest in one of these gadgets. Sure, it could do with a couple of tweaks to make the adapter perfect, but I have zero issues with using it just the way it is.
